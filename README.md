# RPS Challenge

This challenge consists on createing a TDD web page with the ability of creating a user that can play rock-paper-scissors against the computer.

The whole application was written in Ruby and HTML, with RSpec for Unit Tests and Capybara for Feature tests.

# Approach

I started coding the functionality of the classes that would be needed, such as 'game' and 'player' before I coded the view or controller aspect of it.
